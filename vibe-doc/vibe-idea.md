# Idea

I am going to make a incremental game, named `lord of the text`.

It is a base building, incremental game. 

Player have  a base, the lord manor. 

With building: 
TODO:
 - brain storm list of building
 - it should have: resource collector (timber, farm, ... ), training (barrack), ... it must be include, but not limited to above. 

 Enemy: surrounding, target to conquest, include but not limit to village, monster, castle. Each conquest may grant
- passive buff 
- item 
- a new 'base' to managed


There are many type of base, so we copy idea from Crusader King III. Include but not limit to: castle, city, village, temple, ...

# Idea expand 1
Here is an expanded concept plan for Lord of the Text, keeping it incremental but with deep base-building and conquest elements inspired by strategy games.

1. Core Gameplay Loop
Produce resources →

Expand and upgrade your base →

Train armies / develop culture →

Conquer surrounding territories →

Gain buffs, new bases, and prestige →

Repeat with higher stakes

2. Base: The Lord’s Manor
The Manor is the central hub and heart of the player’s kingdom.
Upgrading it unlocks new buildings, policies, and resource caps.

3. Building Categories
A. Resource Production
Lumber Camp / Sawmill – Produces timber; essential for construction.

Quarry – Produces stone; required for defensive structures.

Iron Mine – Produces iron; used for weapons and armor.

Farm / Orchard / Pasture – Produces food; supports population growth and armies.

Hunting Lodge – Produces food + rare animal pelts (can be traded).

Fishing Wharf – Steady food source; less seasonal fluctuation.

B. Military & Training
Barracks – Trains infantry; increases garrison strength.

Archery Range – Trains ranged units; boosts siege potential.

Stable – Produces cavalry; enhances mobility and flanking.

Siege Workshop – Constructs siege engines; unlocks castle conquests.

Guard Tower – Improves base defense passively.

C. Infrastructure & Administration
Marketplace – Allows trade; converts surplus into other resources.

Blacksmith / Armorer – Upgrades equipment for troops.

Town Hall – Improves tax income and unlocks civic policies.

Granary / Storehouse – Expands resource storage capacity.

Road Network – Increases trade efficiency and troop movement speed.

D. Cultural & Prestige
Temple / Shrine – Increases faith; unlocks spiritual bonuses.

Library / Scholar’s Hall – Produces “Knowledge” resource; unlocks tech upgrades.

Monument / Statue – Boosts prestige and passive morale bonuses.

Guild Hall – Unlocks special mercenaries or economic perks.

4. Enemy & Conquest System
Types of Territories
Village – Low defense, provides food or gold tribute.

Town / City – Medium defense, generates tax income & trade options.

Castle / Fortress – High defense, grants strong passive buffs (e.g., troop damage).

Temple / Monastery – Provides religious bonuses (e.g., faith, blessings).

Monster Den – Rewards rare resources or magical buffs.

Ruins – Randomized rewards; may trigger unique events.

Conquest Rewards
Passive Buffs (e.g., +10% resource production, faster training time).

Unique Items (e.g., Banner of War, Crown of Authority).

New Bases – Manage multiple locations with different specialties.

Special Units – Only trainable in certain conquered regions.

5. Multiple Base Types (inspired by CKIII)
Castle Base – Defensive focus, military buffs.

City Base – Economic powerhouse, trade bonuses.

Village Base – Agricultural hub, high food output.

Temple Base – Religious influence, spiritual buffs.

Fortress Outpost – Forward military base; speeds conquest in that region.

6. Progression & Scaling
Era Advancement – Start in early medieval → advance to late medieval → Renaissance-style improvements.

Technologies – Unlocked via knowledge (from libraries, scholars, events).

Prestige Levels – Gained via conquests, monuments, and special achievements. Unlocks cosmetic and functional perks.

Events & Choices – Random text-based events requiring player decisions (moral dilemmas, economic crises, invasions).

7. Incremental/Idle Mechanics
Resources accumulate automatically; upgrades increase speed.
