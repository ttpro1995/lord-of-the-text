# Entry 3

## Resource Initialization Update

### Changes Made:
1. **Initial Resources**: Updated initial timber and stone resources from 0 to 60 each in `src/App.jsx`
2. **Test Updates**: Modified tests in `tests/app.test.js` to expect 60 initial timber instead of 0
3. **Work Log**: Created this entry to document the changes

### Files Modified:
- `src/App.jsx`: Updated initialState.resources.timber and initialState.resources.stone to 60
- `tests/app.test.js`: Updated test to expect 60 initial timber

### Reason for Change:
To provide players with a starting resource base that allows for immediate building and gameplay engagement.

### Next Steps:
- Verify all tests pass with the new initial resource values
- Continue development with the updated resource baseline
