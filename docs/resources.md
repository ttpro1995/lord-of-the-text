# Resources

Lord of the Text features seven primary resources that players must manage to progress through the game. These resources are produced by buildings, consumed by construction and training, and are essential for expanding your kingdom.

## Resource Types

### Basic Resources

| Resource | Primary Producers | Usage Examples | Storage caps start at 200 |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Timber** | Lumber Camp, Sawmill, Hunting Lodge | Building construction, tool crafting | Unlimited growth with Warehouses |
| **Stone** | Quarry, Mining Quarry | Construction, fortifications, roads | Unlimited growth with Warehouses |
| **Iron** | Iron Mine, Dwarven Mine | Weapons, armor, advanced tools | Unlimited growth with Warehouses |
| **Food** | Farm, Orchard, Pasture, Fishing Wharf, Hunting Lodge | Population maintenance, unit upkeep | Unlimited growth with Granaries |

### Advanced Resources

| Resource | Primary Producers | Usage Examples |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Gold** | Gold Mine, Marketplace, Trade Port, Tavern | High-tier upgrades, mercenaries, policies |
| **Knowledge** | Library, Scholar's Hall, Observatory, University | Researching technologies, unlocking new content |
| **Faith** | Temple, Shrine, Monastery, Cathedral | Special blessings, holy units, cultural bonuses |

## Production Rates

Production rates increase with building levels and applied buffs. Base production rates (per minute) include:

- **Timber**: 5 per Lumber Camp at Level 1 (scales up)
- **Stone**: 4 per Quarry at Level 1
- **Iron**: 2 per Iron Mine at Level 1
- **Food**: 3 per Farm at Level 1
- **Gold**: 2 per Gold Mine at Level 1
- **Knowledge**: 1 per Library at Level 1
- **Faith**: 1 per Temple at Level 1

### Upgrade Scaling

Buildings typically increase production by 15-25% per level upgrade, with dependencies unlocking higher-tier buildings for exponential growth.

## Resource Caps

- **Base Caps**: All resources start with 200 storage capacity
- **Expansion**: Warehouse (for Timber/Iron/Stone) and Granary (for Food) increase caps by 100 per level
- **Idle Mechanics**: Resources stop accumulating when storage is full
- **Importance**: Managing caps is crucial to prevent production halts

## Usage and Consumption

### Construction Costs
Resources are spent on building new structures:

- Basic buildings: Timber + Stone
- Advanced buildings: Include Food/Iron dependencies
- Example Farm level 1: 40 Timber, 20 Stone
- Example Barracks level 1: 70 Timber, 50 Food

### Unit Training Costs
- **Peasant Spear**: 10 Food, 5 Timber (per unit)
- Higher-tier units: Include Iron, Gold, etc.
- Upkeep costs: 1 Food per minute per unit tier

### Technology Research
- Primarily consumes Knowledge
- Advanced research may require Gold or Faith

## Resource Management Strategies

1. **Production Optimization**
   - Build multiple instances of efficient buildings
   - Upgrade buildings to increase output rates
   - Balance production across all resource types

2. **Storage Expansion**
   - Build Warehouses and Granaries early
   - Prevents production waste during idle periods

3. **Dependency Chains**
   - Quarry Level 2 unlocks Iron Mine
   - Farm Level 2 unlocks Barracks
   - Plan building orders to maintain resource flow

4. **Advanced Resources**
   - Knowledge unlocks new technologies
   - Faith enables religious units and bonuses
   - Gold facilitates trade and special units

## Idle Mechanics

Resources accumulate automatically while offline (capped by current storage limits). The game saves progress locally, allowing passive progression even when not actively playing.
