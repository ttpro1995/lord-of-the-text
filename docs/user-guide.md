# User Guide

Step-by-step walkthrough of Lord of the Text gameplay.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the game: `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

### First Steps
- Observe automatic resource accumulation
- Build your first Lumber Camp to increase timber production
- Expand storage with Warehouse when reaching caps
- Unlock new building types through progression

## Basic Gameplay

### Resource Production
- Timber: From Lumber Camps
- Stone: From Quarries
- Iron: From Iron Mines (requires Quarry Level 2)
- Food: From Farms (trains units, sustains population)

### Building Construction
1. Click on an available building
2. Check resource costs in the UI
3. Confirm construction if affordable
4. Wait for completion (or build instantly when available)

### Upgrading Buildings
1. Select a built building
2. Click "Upgrade" when sufficient resources
3. Higher levels increase production rates
4. Some upgrades unlock new features

## Military System

### Training Units
1. Build Barracks and Archery Range as dependencies
2. Check available units in training interface
3. Select unit and quantity
4. Confirm if resources available

### Army Composition
- **Infantry**: Basic defense and conquest
- **Archers**: Ranged support, good vs infantry
- **Cavalry**: Flanking and mobility
- **Siege**: Anti-fortification heavy damage

### Conquest
1. Drag units into army composition
2. Select target territory
3. Compare army strength vs defense
4. Successful conquest yields rewards

## Advanced Mechanics

### Dependency Chains
- Iron Mine requires Quarry Level 2
- Barracks requires Farm Level 2
- Higher-tier units require upgraded buildings

### Technology Research
1. Build Library to generate Knowledge
2. Spend Knowledge on technology unlocks
3. Technologies improve production or unlock new content

### Multi-Base Management
- Conquered territories become additional bases
- Switch between bases via tabs
- Each base has unique bonuses
- Manage resources and buildings separately

## Strategy Tips

### Early Game
- Focus on storage first (Warehouse/Granary)
- Build dependency chain: Quarry â†’ Iron Mine
- Pump out Peasant Spearmen for basic conquest

### Mid Game
- Invest heavily in technology research
- Upgrade military buildings for unit caps
- Conquer strategic territories for bonuses

### Late Game
- Optimize production with multiple bases
- Research advanced technologies
- Build prestige-generating structures

## Common Patterns

### Resource Optimization
- Balance production across all types
- Upgrade frequently for exponential gains
- Use Marketplace for resource conversion when stuck

### Combat Strategy
- Match unit composition to target type
- Use siege vs castles, cavalry vs infantry
- Maintain defensive forces for base protection

### Progression Planning
- Unlock new content systematically
- Save for major purchases
- Time-file:lg research during high-production periods

## Troubleshooting

### Stuck with Resources?
- Check storage caps and build/upgrade storage
- Use Marketplace to convert surplus
- Ensure production rates are balanced

### Can't Build Something?
- Verify dependency requirements
- Check building availability in UI
- Upgrade prerequisite structures

### Training Not Working?
- Confirm unit caps aren't full
- Verify sufficient resources
- Check barracks/archery range levels

## Save/Load System

- Progress saves automatically every 10 seconds
- Manual save: Press 'S' key
- Manual load: Press 'L' key
- Offline progress accumulates up to storage limits
